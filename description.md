Attribute Information:
1) ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32)
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) c) perimeter d) area e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) i) symmetry j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features.
In this blog, analyses of collinearity and dimensional reduction are discussed.
